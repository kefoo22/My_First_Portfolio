  <h1>Welcome to My First Cool Webpage!</h1>

  <h2>About This Page</h2>
  <p>This is my very first attempt at creating a webpage using HTML. I'm excited to learn and build more as I go along!</p>

  <h2>Why I Love Web Development</h2>
  <p>Web development allows you to turn creative ideas into interactive experiences on the internet. It's both a technical and artistic skill.</p>

  <h3>What I'm Currently Learning</h3>
  <p>Right now, I'm exploring the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This page is part of my practice for an awesome program I'm part of.</p>

  <h3>Future Goals</h3>
  <p>My goal is to create beautiful, responsive, and accessible web experiences that people love to use. I can't wait to build my first portfolio site.</p>
